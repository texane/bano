	REHANDSHAKING SUPPORT
	In late 2009 An "authentication gap" exploit was discovered in the
	SSL re-handshaking protocol.  The fix to the exploit was introduced
	in RFC 5746 and is referred to here	as SECURE_REHANDSHAKES.
	
	ENABLE_SECURE_REHANDSHAKES implements RFC 5746 and will securely
	renegotiate with any implementations that support it.  It is
	recommended to leave this enabled.
	
	By enabling REQUIRE_SECURE_REHANDSHAKES, the library will test that each
	communicating peer has implemented RFC 5746 and will terminate handshakes
	with any that have not.
	
	If working with SSL peers that have not implemented RFC 5746 and
	rehandshakes are required, you may enable ENABLE_INSECURE_REHANDSHAKES
	but it is NOT RECOMMENDED
			
	It is a conflict to enable both ENABLE_INSECURE_REHANDSHAKES and
	REQUIRE_SECURE_REHANDSHAKES and a compile error will occur
	
	To completely disable rehandshaking comment out all three of these defines

	Google has an implementation of HTTPS client (Chrome) that sends application
	data immedately after the client FINISHED message, and before the server
	has responded with a CHANGE_CIPHER_SPEC and FINISHED message. This saves
	a round trip when sending the HTTP request, since it is sent with the
	FINISHED message in a single IP packet, and does not wait for the server
	handshake response.

	A similar technique is used and supported by MatrixSSL for including
	application data at the end of a finished message that does not require
	a response (a standard server Finished message for example). However,
	this implementation in Chrome is subtly and importantly different.

	MatrixSSL was written to explicitly ignore any data after any handshake
	message that requires a response, because in all cases, this response
	changes the state of the client.

	Chrome cannot be assured that the final handshake hash matches (and that
	the handshake was not tampered with) before it sends the potentially
	sensitive HTTP request.

	Apparently most other SSL implementations do allow this "trick" to 
	succeed, and so we have added support as well using a conditional compile.
	Enabling this allows Chrome browsers to connect to HTTPS servers running
	MatrixSSL. Sending app data with a client finished message from MatrixSSL
	is still NOT SUPPORTED for the security reasons above.

	For more information:
	http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bmoeller-tls-falsestart-00	

	UPDATE April 2012: Google has announced this feature will be removed in
	version 20 of their browser due to industry compatibility issues.

/*
    In Sept. 2011 security researchers demonstrated how a previously known
    CBC encryption weakness could be used to decrypt HTTP data over SSL.
    The attack was named BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS).
 
	This issue only effects TLS 1.0 (and SSL) and only if the cipher suite
	is using a symmetric CBC block cipher.  Enable USE_TLS_1_1 above to
	completely negate this workaround if TLS 1.1 is also supported by peers.
   
    As with previous SSL vulnerabilities, the attack is generally considered
    a very low risk for individual browsers as it requires the attacker
    to have control over the network to become a MITM.  They will also have
    to have knowledge of the first couple blocks of underlying plaintext
    in order to mount the attack.
    
    A zero length record proceeding a data record has been a known fix to this
    problem for years and MatrixSSL has always supported the handling of empty
    records. So alternatively, an implementation could always encode a zero
	length record before each record encode. Some old SSL implementations do
	not handle decoding zero length records, however.
   
    This BEAST fix is on the client side and moves the implementation down to
    the SSL library level so users do not need to manually send zero length
    records. This fix uses the same IV obfuscation logic as a zero length
    record by breaking up each application data record in two. Because some 
	implementations don't handle zero-length records, the the first record
    is the first byte of the plaintext message, and the second record
	contains the remainder of the message.
 
	This fix is based on the workaround implemented in Google Chrome:
	http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=97269

	This workaround adds approximagely 53 bytes to the encoded length of each 
	SSL record that is encoded, due to the additional header, padding and MAC
	of the second record.
