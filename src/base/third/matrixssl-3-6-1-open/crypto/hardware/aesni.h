	Our usage in SSL is that any given key is used only for either encryption
	or decryption, not both. If the same key is to be used for both, two 
	key structures must be initialized.
	The first use of the key is what marks the key's usage (for example if
	psAesEncryptBlock() is called on the key first, it can only be used
	in future calls to encrypt.
