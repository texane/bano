BANO is an open framework to implement to implement cheap RF
nodes, as well as a base station that makes them connected to
the Internet over HTTP. While the concept is not clear to me,
I guess it can be seen as an 'Internet of Things' platform.

An introductory blog post can be found here:
http://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/605.php

The node development kit documentation is in:
doc/node_sdk

It contains instruction on how to install the SDK. You can find
examples in the SDK documentation itself, and in separate project
repositories such as:
https://github.com/texane/bano_reed

The BANO protocol documentation is in:
doc/protocol

The base documentation is still to be written.
